## Pandas

If you have used the statistical programming language R, you are familiar with
"data frames", two-dimensional data structures where each column can hold a 
different type of data, as in a spreadsheet.

The analagous data frame package for Python is [pandas](){:.pylib},
which provides a `DataFrame` object type with methods to subset,
filter reshape and aggregate tabular data.

After importing [pandas](){:.pylib}, we call its `read_csv` function
to load the [County Business Patterns (CBP)] dataset.
